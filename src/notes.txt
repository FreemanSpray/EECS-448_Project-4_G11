Refactoring goals:
	current system of actions and triggers does not allow any action or triggered action
		to be prevented by anything else

	movement actions require source tile to be passed in as well as target tile. this is
		because movement is just deleting the unit from the source tile and creating
		a copy at the target tile. 


Need to put guards on all ranges/relevent so that trying to access tiles outside the map doesn't
	cause an error
