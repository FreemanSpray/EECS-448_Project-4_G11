Refactoring goals:
	current system of actions and triggers does not allow any action or triggered action
		to be prevented by anything else

	movement actions require source tile to be passed in as well as target tile. this is
		because movement is just deleting the unit from the source tile and creating
		a copy at the target tile. 

	A lot of information is needing to be passed down in an unintuitive way. e.g. playerID
		is passed into hand constructor > passed into card constructors > passed into
		action constructor > passed into unit constructor, so that a unit can know who
		owns it


Need to put guards on all ranges/relevent so that trying to access tiles outside the map doesn't
	cause an error
